Oral Reports of Members
<br>● Campus-Wide Senator, Miguel Tapia
○ Made notion to have a moderated Caucus of 15 minutes
<br>■ Wants to encourage AS and UC San Diego to support AFSCME because they are
a working union who may go on a strike so that they are promised fair wages,
affordable healthcare, retirement with dignity, job security with no contracting
out, ban the box, targeted local hire program, strengthened sexual harassment
protections, increased wages for student workers, and non-collaboration with
ICE.
<br>● AFSCME 3299 members are 85% women, immigrants, and people of
color. This fight is not only about economic equality, but also racial and
gender equality.
<br>■ The politics of this strike demands our support because Black and Latinx workers
face inequalities such as starting wages that are 20-21 percent less, respectively,
than white folks.
<br>● We as ASUCSD pledge to support AFSCME 3299 members in their
fight for racial and economic justice by:
○ Sending a letter to UC President Janet Napolitano
○ Coming out to support AFSCME 3299 actions
○ Honoring all AFSCME 3299 picket lines, strikes and boycotts.
<br>● Campus Wide-Senator, Aseel Ali
